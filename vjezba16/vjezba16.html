    <p>The Rimac Nevera  is an all-electric sports car designed and manufactured by the Croatian automotive manufacturer Rimac Automobili. The first production prototype car was released in August 2021. Rimac will produce 150 vehicles and is currently in the process of homologation for the global market. Nevera is manufactured in the same factory and at the same rate (of roughly 1 per week) as the Pininfarina Battista, which is based on the same platform.</p>
	<p>The car was unveiled at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show under the Name "Rimac Concept Two" but renamed to Rimac Nevera upon its launch, it is the automaker's second car after the Rimac Concept One and is described as "the ultimate electric hypercar driving experience". The name Nevera comes from the Croatian word for sudden and short storms, usually accompanied by lightning, which occur primarily along the Croatian Adriatic coast.</p>
   <p>The Rimac Nevera was initially revealed as the C_Two concept car. Since 2018, Rimac spent over three years refining the car as part of an extensive test and development programme. Almost all key components of the Nevera are designed and manufactured at Rimac's headquarters near Zagreb, Croatia. During the global homologation process, the company constructed 4 prototypes for different testing purposes.[1] In June 2020, Rimac opened a new facility in Veliko Trgovišće which will serve as the assembly for Nevera homologation prototypes as well as future production vehicles for customers. At full capacity, the facility should produce 4 vehicles per month and currently plans to produce an additional 13 prototype vehicles by the end of 2020. The delivery of production cars to customers was initially planned in 2020 but was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
	<p>Each of the Nevera's four wheels is individually driven by surface-mounted magnet motors. Combined, they produce a total of 1,427 kW (1,914 hp) and 2,360 N⋅m (1,741 lbf⋅ft) of torque. A single-stage gearbox links the front and rear wheels. The Nevera allegedly has the ability to accelerate from 0–97 km/h (0–60 mph) in 1.85 seconds, making it potentially the fastest-accelerating production car in the world. According to Rimac Automobili, it will accelerate from 0–161 km/h (0–100 mph)0 in 4.3 seconds, 0–299 km/h (0–186 mph) in 9.3 seconds, and has a top speed of 412 km/h (256 mph).</p>
    <p>Jonathan Lopez of Top Speed magazine acclaimed Nevera stating that "it is an absolute game changer, and not just in the EV segment. Between the onboard tech and mind-boggling performance specs, this machine has the goods to take on the best of the best."</p>
